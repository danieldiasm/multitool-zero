## RPi Zero W OLED Multitool

This is a library for you to develop your own multi-tool using RPi-Zero W and 
the (Waveshare 1.3 OLED HAT)[https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.3inch_OLED_HAT].

I've just started doing it, but so far I plan on doing:

- A Splash screen module for program startup
- A menu manager
